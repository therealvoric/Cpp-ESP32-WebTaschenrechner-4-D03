# Web Calculator using ESP32 Async Web Server

### This project demonstrates a simple web calculator built using an ESP32 microcontroller and the Async Web Server library. The calculator is accessible through a web interface hosted on the ESP32, allowing users to perform basic arithmetic operations.
## Features

    Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
    User-friendly web interface
    Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Hardware Requirements

    ESP32 microcontroller
    Appropriate power source

## Software Requirements

    Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
    ESP32 board support package
    Async TCP and ESP Async Web Server libraries

## Usage

    Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
    Open the project in Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
    Upload the code to your ESP32.
    Connect to the WiFi network hosted by your ESP32.
    Open a web browser and navigate to the IP address of your ESP32.
    Use the web interface to perform calculations.

## File Structure

    src/main.cpp: Arduino sketch containing the ESP32 code.
    data/index.html: HTML file for the calculator web interface.
    data/style.css: CSS file for styling the web interface.
    data/script.js: JavaScript file for handling user interactions.
